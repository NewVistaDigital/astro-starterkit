```

Update `consts.ts` with relevant site information.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚  â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/     Things like CTA, Galleries, etc.
â”‚  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ site/        Head, Footer, Header, etc.
â”‚  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ui/          Buttons, Forms, Links, Alert, etc.
â”‚  â”œâ”€â”€ content/         If a blog is used, it goes here.
â”‚  â”œâ”€â”€ js/              Any js script components.
â”‚  â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/         Typically BaseLayout will do.
â”‚  â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚  â”œâ”€â”€ config.yml       Unused for now.
â”‚  â””â”€â”€ consts.ts        All site variables set here.
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
